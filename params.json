{"name":"Dynamic Array Toolset","tagline":"for Autodesk Maya","body":"Dynamic Array Tools\r\n================\r\n\r\nDynamic Arrays are special arrays in Maya that you can use with the instancer node. This means you can generate points and the instancer will display meshes instead of points. This toolset will help you manipulate the points in a non-destructive matter.\r\n\r\n**Note: This is a toolset that is still under development**\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n\r\nFor any questions regarding this toolset, feel free to contact me at [jhoolmans at gmail dot com](mailto:jhoolmans@gmail.com?subject=DynArrayTools)\r\n\r\nAny bugs, requests or issues can be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhoolmans/Maya_DynArrayTools/issues).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
